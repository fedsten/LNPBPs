## Abstract

The standard defines an algorithm for deterministic definition of the
transaction output containing cryptographic commitments made under the standards
LNPBP-1 [1] and LNPBP-2 [2].


## Background

Embedding cryptographic commitments into Bitcoin blockchain has become a common
practice [3]. Bitcoin blockchain provides strong guarantees on the underlying
data immutability, presenting a reliable, distributed and censorship-resitent
proof-of-publication [4] medium. While existing standards defines how the
cryptographic commitments can be used with public keys on SECP256k1 elliptic
curve (used by Bitcoin) and embedded within transaction outputs, it still has to
be defined how the interested parties may detect which of a Bitcoin transaction
output contains the commitment, created under some specific protocol, including
those interoperable with LNPBP-1 and LNPBP-2 standards.


## Motivation

A number of use cases for cryptographic commitments (CC) require some commitment
to be unique. For instance, single-use seals [5] may utilize them to achieve
it's one-time commitment properties, as may be required in some of the
applications [6], [7]. While the deterministic way for embedding into Bitcoin
transactions (like "always use the first output) may be defined on a
per-protocol basis, it seems that some best-practices, defining the best
privacy-preserving and secure algorithm for such deterministic commitments in
Bitcoin transactions may also be useful for the industry.

Some of the protocols relies on the first OP_RETURN output present in the
transaction to contain the commitment [3]. However, this would not work for
commitments supporting other output types ([2], [8]), and for may introduce
collisions with other protocols using OP_RETURN, like OMNI Layer [9].

Static definition of the output containing the commitment will be incompatible
with BIP-69 [10], defining deterministic transaction output ordering and will
not work with current Lightning Network implementation following the same rules
[11].


## Specification

Cryptographic commitments under this standard are made according to LNPBP-1 [1]
and LNPBP-2 [2] standards.

To deterministically define the number of transaction output that contains CC
under some protocol `P`, the committing party "Alice" `A` (which may be
represented by a single person or some m-of-n federation) and the verifying 
party "Bob" `B` (which may be represented by a single person or some m-of-n
federation) need to agree  on three parameters:
1. A protocol-defined parameter `s`, acting as a seed for all protocol-wide
   commitments, this must be a 8-bit value;
2. A commitment-specific parameter `c`, which should not be directly reflected
   in the transaction, containing the given CC. This parameter under some
   circumstances (agreed by the parties beforehand) may be absent. The value of 
   `c` must be a 8-bit value.

These two parameters serve as a "salt" for the deterministic procedure,
preventing third-parties from guessing the information of the actual commitment,
thus avoiding possible censorship by the miners and on-chain based transaction
analysis.

Alice, creating the transaction containing CC, and Bob, verifying it, must use
the following procedure:

1. Compute the transaction fee `f`, as a difference between total transaction
   output amounts in satoshis and total inputs amounts, in satoshis:  
   `f = sum(outputs) - sum(inputs)`.  
   This can be done, for instance, by utilizing data from a partially-singed 
   bitcoin transaction, or by contacting Electrum Server or Bitcoin Core backend.
   It should be noted, that according to Bitcoin consensus rules, this amount 
   must always be positive and greater than zero(`f > 0`); otherwise it is not a
   valid Bitcoin transaction and the protocol must fail.
2. Compute the adjusted fee `a` as a 32-bit modulo of the potentially-64 bit 
   number `f`:  
   `a = f mod 2^32`.
3. Add to this number a previously-agreed values of `s` and `c` (if `c` was 
   not defined, use `0` for `c` value by default). This will give a 
   commitment-factor `x`:  
   `x = a + s + c`.  
   Since `s` and `c` is a 8-bit numbers and `a` is a 32-bit number, the result 
   will fit a 64-bit number without overflow.
4. Get the number of outputs `n` for the transaction containing the output with 
   the given cryptographic commitment.
5. Compute `d` as `d = x mod n`. The `d` will represent an index of the output
   which must contain a cryptographic commitment. All other transaction outputs
   will not be a valid outputs for a contain cryptographic commitment under the
   used protocol.


## Compatibility

The proposed standard is incompatible with many of existing practices for 
definition of the transaction output containing cryptographic commitment, 
including OpenTimestamps, which uses first transaction output for storing the
commitment [1]

Nevertheless, use of protocol-specific pre-defined salt may be utilised as a 
flag signalling the support of the current standard, which will help to avoid
possible commitment collisions across different protocols.

Future SIGHASH_NOINPUT standard BIP-118 [12] may be compatible with this
proposal, since a protocol utilizing the present standard may define that any
transaction commitment with an input signature flag set to SIGHASH_NOINPUT must
default to the zero value of commitment-specific parameter `c`. This will still
preserve the privacy from the onchain analysis tools due to the presence of the
protocol-specific parameter `s`, which will be unknown for any party that does
know which protocol is used by some transaction (given the fact that the used
protocol can't be guessed from the transaction itself).


## Rationale

The rationale for the technical decisions is provided within the specification
